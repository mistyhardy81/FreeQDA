Interview Introduction #1

As the nation deals with the recent pandemic, causing several people to be quarantined and isolate, not being able to visit with others, we are left wondering if isolation can take a toll on a person’s wellbeing. It is important for people to be aware of how important keeping yourself entertained is, to eliminate a decline in a person’s health. This can also allow for ideas for individuals to prevent boredom or loneliness.    

The purpose of this interview is to better understand a person’s current level of loneliness, companionship during a pandemic or quarantine.

MH:	How would you describe your current mood during COVID-19?

AS:	Some days have been better than others, I don’t like being stuck inside and not having any visitors. 


MH:	How would you describe your current living situation during COVID-19?

AS:	I live in this place (as she looks around). 

MH:	Do you remember learning about self-isolation or loneliness? Or quarantining?

AS:	Oh, they talked about quarantining back in the day for some illnesses, but I don’t recall much of it.  There wasn’t much we ever learned about isolation. 

MH:	How often do you feel that you lack companionship? 

AS:	Well almost every damn day since I have been put in here. 

MH:	How often do you feel that you have a lot in common with the people around you?

AS:	Oh hell, some days I can get along with them and others they drive me crazy.  I don’t think that I have much in common with any of them anymore.

MH:	How often do you feel close to people?

AS:	When my family visits and they haven’t been able to come for weeks.

MH:	Are there any moments that you feel left out?

AS:	Ahhh, not so much left out, I don’t care all that much.

MH:	Do you ever feel that no one really knows you well?

AS:	No one knows me here, they don’t know what I have done. 

MH:	How often do you feel isolated from others? Do you think you isolate yourself? 

AS:	I don’t isolate myself, and I don’t feel isolated from others- they (staff) try to make us do things all the time together.

MH:	How often do you feel that there are people who really understand you?

AS:	Oh, maybe when my family comes to visit but they don’t really know everything either.

MH:	How often do you feel that people are around you but not with you?

AS:	Every day in here. 

MH:	How often do you feel that there are people you can talk to?

AS:	Ahhh, I can talk to anyone in here, not that they listen, but I can talk. (laughs)

MH:	Do you feel or believe that there are people you can turn to?

AS:	I suppose so, maybe my son and daughter. 

MH:	Do you feel as though the answers to these questions would differ if it were not for the current pandemic?
(Cigna, 2020).

AS:	No, it is always the same in here- with that virus, makes it harder for me to see my family and that makes me sad.  But I don’t want anyone to get sick either.  

MH:	Thank you so much for your time and answering the questions. I appreciate your time, effort and willingness to do this interview with me.  Now that I am a volunteer, you will be seeing more of me around here.  

AS:  Oh, you come back anytime.

INTERVIEW #2- 24yo Caucasian Female residing in Southern Florida while attending college (away from home)
		*Recorded via Samsung Cellular Device- 7/10/20 Interview was 24:57 in length



MH:	How would you describe your current mood during COVID-19?

CD:	It really depends on the day- most days haven’t been too bad, but it has really taken me out of my element especially with practicum being on hold and not going to school. It takes a toll on me; at one point I wasn’t even taking care of myself all that well.
	MH:  What do you mean by not taking care of yourself?
	CD:   Well, I was sleeping a lot, not wanting to get out of bed, drinking too much wine. (laughs)

MH:	How would you describe your current living situation during COVID-19?

CD:	I live alone in a 1-bedroom apartment, my boyfriend often stays over, but the pool is shutdown, and I don’t want to leave my house except for work or anything that may be school related. All my family lives in California, so I am not even able to quarantine with them, I have been quarantining alone or at times with my boyfriend. 

MH:	Do you remember learning about self-isolation or loneliness? Or quarantining?

CD:	Never, to be honest, I have learned about loneliness the more I have to leave home especially for school.  

MH:	How often do you feel that you lack companionship? 

CD:	Lack? I have never really thought about it, but I don’t really feel that I lack companionship, I do have my boyfriend and friends in the area that I do keep in contact with as well as my friends and family back home. 

MH:	How often do you feel that you have a lot in common with the people around you?

CD:	Well right now, my life is consumed by psychological schooling, so we all have that in common.  Outside of school, we have different things in common but are still able to connect.  I think it is interesting to know people with different interests than me. 

MH:	How often do you feel close to people?

CD:	For me, this really depends on the mood that I am in.  I know that I have many people that I am close too and can reach out to, but I don’t always do that. 

MH:	Are there any moments that you feel left out?

CD:	Oh sure. 
	MH:  Do you remember specific moments?
	CD:  Just when I was a kid but most recently, was a couple of girlfriends made plans and didn’t ask me.  Which it bothered me at first then I was like, oh god who cares.  

MH:	Do you ever feel that no one really knows you well?

CD:	No, I try to be an open book and just be myself.  I let people know what I want them to know and if they want to know more, I will let them know.  

MH:	How often do you feel isolated from others? Do you think you isolate yourself? 

CD:	NOW!!!!  Everything and everyone are isolating due to COVID.  I don’t normally isolate myself from others but now we have no choice.  

MH:	How often do you feel that there are people who really understand you?

CD:	I have a few close friends that I believe really understand me and what I stand for.  My boyfriend, my family.  

MH:	How often do you feel that people are around you but not with you?

CD:	Going through the college process, this happens regularly but I don’t look too much into.  Some people are just not everyone’s cup of tea, it is what it is.  

MH:	How often do you feel that there are people you can talk to?

CD:	I always have someone that I can call, usually I am calling my Mom to talk.  

MH:	Do you feel or believe that there are people you can turn to?

CD:	Absolutely, my family is very supportive of me and my journey through school.  I know that I can always turn to my boyfriend and the few close friends that I have.  

MH:	Do you feel as though the answers to these questions would differ if it were not for the current pandemic?
(Cigna, 2020).

CD:	Yes, absolutely.  This pandemic has caused a lot of uncertainty and it has put strains on many levels- academic, professional, personal, it has been a crazy ride and from the sounds of it, it continues to keep riding that wave.  
MH:	Thank you for taking time out of the day to meet with me for this interview, I really appreciate it. 

CD:	Of course, if there is anything else that I can help with, just let me know.  


REFLECTION

I believe that the data that I was able to collect was beneficial- I seen the difference between the two interviews being the age difference and where they were at during their lives during the current pandemic.  The first interview with AS was more of a struggle because of age and hearing capabilities and the slower speech but she was an absolute gem to conduct an interview with.  I wish that I could have had more time, but AS seemed to be losing interest in the interview with not really knowing how to fully comprehend the questions that were being asked of her.  
The second interview seemed to go more smoothly as the interviewee was much more aware of the current pandemic and had many lifestyle activities that were affected.  I was able to relate more to her.  However, regardless both interviews showed signs of loneliness and the wanting to interact with others.  CD talked quickly, and it was hard to transcribe the audio recording but after many listens to the audio recording, I was able to retrieve the transcribe.  
Each interview provided valuable information, I was happy that I chose the people that I did, the age difference was helpful because they showed the same signs of loneliness during this current pandemic that does not seem to be ending anytime soon.  Being that we are in South Florida, we have a lot up in the air right now; where Interview #2 was able to comprehend that much more than Interview #1. 
I did learn that no matter your age, being isolated or quarantined during a pandemic has large impacts on people and their mindset.  I think when you do not fully understand the severity of the pandemic makes it much more difficult to function because you are left wondering why my family cannot come visit.  When conducting these interviews, I could only help to think about what my own answers would be, to be honest, quarantining is not much different from my normal life, I do not go out often but to work and the grocery store.  However, everything has changed when even going to the grocery store.  I have moments of loneliness but not the levels of both interviewees.
